# Scripts

Scripts, files, and other misc files for personal use. Many of these interact with shell scripts I wrote in zshrc.

## Cattle
Files for keeping track of software packages for easy installation.

## Google Photos Backup
Set of scripts to help automate backing up media from my phone and compress it. 

gp\_download.py downloads all media from Google Photos. (Note: deleting of media must be done manually, can't be done with the API).

vid\_c.sh compresses all video files (-i for input, -o for output).


## Notebook
Filespace for Jupyter notebook workspace.

## Ubuntu-Sandbox
Files related to running Ubuntu workspace with Vagrant.
