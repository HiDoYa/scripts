# Scripts

Scripts, files, and other misc files for personal use. Many of these interact with shell scripts I wrote in zshrc.

- cattle (Keeps track of software packages for easy installation)
- cmds (Shows description for custom bash functions/aliases)
- dotfiles (Saving dotfiles for git, tmux, vim, zsh)
- gp-backup (Automate backing up media from my phone and compress it)
- linux-dev (Automate running ubuntu workspace)
- metadata-ext (Extract music metadata from files)
- notebook (Filespace for Jupyter notebook workspace)
- smart-mv (Smart way of moving files to a dest)
