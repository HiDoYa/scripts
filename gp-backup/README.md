# Google Photos Backup
Set of scripts to help automate backing up media from my phone and compress it. 

gp\_download.py downloads all media from Google Photos. (Note: deleting of media must be done manually, can't be done with the API).

vid\_c.sh compresses all video files (-i for input, -o for output).
