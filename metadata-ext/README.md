# Metadata Extractor

This is a specialized script (that'll probably only ever be used once).

I first got a list of all my songs by running '''ls -alR''' on my local music library, using directory structure to denote playlist name.

Then, I ran the following parse.sh script to separate out the title and authors of the songs and sort them according to the occurence under playlist buckets.
